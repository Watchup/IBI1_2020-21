Improvements I made responding to the Formative Feedback:

In Practical4/index.md: I changed the content to make it different with the Rob's website
In Practical4/Introductions.txt and thingsIlike.txt: Changed Commit description.

In Practical5/mystery_code.py: Added correct answer about what the code does
